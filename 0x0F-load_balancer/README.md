# Load Blalancer
A load balancer is a device or software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources in order to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and ensure high availability and reliability of applications and services.

Load balancers can be hardware-based or software-based, and can work on different layers of the networking stack, such as the Transport layer (e.g., TCP load balancers), the Application layer (e.g., HTTP load balancers), or both (e.g., SSL offloading load balancers).

Load balancing is typically used in environments where the traffic volume exceeds the capacity of a single server or resource, or where the workload is distributed across multiple servers or resources for redundancy, fault tolerance, or scalability reasons. Examples of load-balanced applications include web servers, databases, virtual machines, containers, and microservices.
