# HTTPS:
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol used for secure communication over a computer network, such as the internet. It is an extension of HTTP and adds an extra layer of encryption and authentication using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security).

When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, your web browser establishes a secure connection with the website's server using SSL or TLS. This secure connection ensures that the data transmitted between your browser and the server is encrypted and cannot be easily intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized parties.

## SSL(Secure socket layer)

SSL  use cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data exchanged between the browser and the server. This encryption prevents eavesdropping and protects sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal data, from being intercepted.

In addition to encryption, SSL/TLS also provides authentication. When a browser connects to a website using HTTPS, the website presents a digital certificate that is issued by a trusted third-party certificate authority (CA). The certificate contains information about the website and is digitally signed by the CA. The browser verifies the authenticity of the certificate and the identity of the website, ensuring that you are communicating with the intended website and not an impostor.

By using HTTPS and SSL/TLS, websites can provide a secure and trustworthy browsing experience for their users, protecting sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access to data. It has become the standard for secure communication on the internet, particularly for websites that handle sensitive data, such as online banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.
