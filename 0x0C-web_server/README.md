# Web Server
A web server is a software application that serves HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests from clients, such as web browsers, and returns responses, usually in the form of web pages or other web-based resources.

Web servers typically run on dedicated machines or in the cloud and are designed to handle multiple concurrent connections from clients. They are responsible for processing requests from clients, retrieving data from databases or other sources, generating HTML or other web content, and sending it back to the client.

Some common web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services), and Google Web Server. These servers are used to host and serve websites, web applications, APIs, and other web-based services.
