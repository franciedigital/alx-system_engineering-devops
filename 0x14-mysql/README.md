# Database primary/cluster replica:
A database primary/replica cluster, also known as a database replication cluster, is a configuration in which multiple database servers are connected to form a cluster for the purpose of replication. The cluster typically consists of a primary server and one or more replica servers.

The primary server is the main server that handles read and write operations from applications or clients. It is responsible for processing write requests, updating the data, and propagating the changes to the replica servers. The replica servers, also called secondary servers, receive and apply the changes from the primary server to keep their data in sync.

The primary/replica cluster provides several benefits, including:

* High availability: If the primary server fails, one of the replica servers can be promoted to become the new primary server, ensuring continuous availability of the database.
* Scalability: By offloading read operations to replica servers, the cluster can handle more read traffic and improve overall performance.
* Load balancing: Incoming read requests can be distributed across replica servers, spreading the workload and preventing a single server from becoming a bottleneck.
* Disaster recovery: Replication allows for creating backups and maintaining a copy of the data on multiple servers. In the event of a disaster, data can be quickly recovered from a replica server.
There are different types of replication mechanisms, such as synchronous replication, asynchronous replication, or semi-synchronous replication. Each has its own trade-offs in terms of data consistency and performance.

It's important to note that while replica servers can handle read queries, write operations typically need to be performed on the primary server to ensure consistency. Replicas are meant to replicate the data from the primary server and are not usually directly writable.

Overall, a primary/replica cluster provides a robust and scalable solution for managing and distributing database workloads, ensuring high availability and data redundancy.
