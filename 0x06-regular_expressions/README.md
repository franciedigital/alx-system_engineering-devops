A regular expression, also known as a regex, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. Regular expressions are commonly used in programming, text processing, and data validation to match, search, and manipulate text.

Regular expressions can include a variety of characters and symbols, which have special meanings. Some examples of commonly used characters and symbols in regular expressions include:

The dot (.) matches any character except a newline character.
The asterisk (*) matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character or group.
The plus sign (+) matches one or more occurrences of the previous character or group.
The question mark (?) matches zero or one occurrence of the previous character or group.
Square brackets ([ ]) create a character set, which matches any one of the characters listed inside.
The caret (^) at the beginning of a character set negates it, matching any character that is not listed inside.
The dollar sign ($) matches the end of a line.
Parentheses () group characters together to create a subexpression, which can be quantified with the repetition operators (*, +, ?).
Regular expressions can be very powerful, but they can also be complex and difficult to understand. It's important to carefully test and validate regular expressions before using them in production code.
