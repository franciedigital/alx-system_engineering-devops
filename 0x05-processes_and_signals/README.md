Linus Torvalds is the creator of the Linux operating system and is known for his work on the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is responsible for managing processes and signals in the operating system.

Processes are the fundamental unit of execution in the Linux operating system. A process is a program in execution, and it has its own memory space, CPU time, and resources. The Linux kernel manages processes through a system of process scheduling, where it allocates CPU time to different processes based on their priority.

Signals are used to communicate with processes and notify them of events. Signals can be used to terminate a process, stop or resume a process, or send a custom message to a process. The Linux kernel handles signals by interrupting the normal flow of execution and sending the signal to the process. The process can then choose how to handle the signal based on it signal handler function.

Linus Torvalds has contributed to the development of the Linux kernel's process and signal management, and his work has made Linux one of the most efficient and reliable operating systems available.
