# REST API
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions that allow communication between two software applications over the internet. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications.

REST APIs are based on the principles of the REST architectural style, which emphasizes a stateless client-server communication model, using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. These methods are used to perform operations on resources represented by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).

## Some key characteristics of a REST API:

* Stateless: Each request from a client to a server contains all the necessary information to understand and process that request. The server does not maintain any client-specific information between requests.

* Resources: REST APIs are centered around resources, which are typically represented as URLs. Each resource can be uniquely identified and accessed via its URL.

* HTTP Verbs: REST APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform different operations on resources. For example, GET is used to retrieve a resource, POST is used to create a new resource, PUT is used to update a resource, and DELETE is used to remove a resource.

Representations: Resources in a REST API can have different representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. The client and server can negotiate the representation format based on the request headers.

Uniform Interface: REST APIs follow a uniform interface, which means they have a consistent and standardized way of accessing and manipulating resources. This allows clients to interact with various APIs using a consistent approach.

REST APIs are widely used for building web services and integrating different systems together. They are popular because they are simple, scalable, and can be consumed by a variety of clients, including web browsers, mobile applications, and other servers.
