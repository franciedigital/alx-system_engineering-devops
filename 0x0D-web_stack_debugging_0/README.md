# Web static debugging
Web static debugging refers to the process of identifying and resolving issues or errors in static web pages or web applications. Unlike dynamic websites or applications that involve server-side processing and data retrieval, static websites are composed of pre-rendered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to the client's browser.

Here are some steps you can take for static web debugging:

Inspect the browser console: Open the browser's developer tools and navigate to the console tab. This is where JavaScript errors and warnings will be displayed. Check for any error messages or warnings that may indicate issues with your scripts or external resources.

Review the network requests: In the network tab of the browser's developer tools, you can see all the requests made by the webpage, including the HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and any additional resources like images or API calls. Look for any failed requests (HTTP status codes other than 200) or missing resources that may be causing issues.

Check the HTML structure: Inspect the HTML code of your page and ensure that the structure is correct. Make sure all the necessary HTML tags are properly opened and closed, and there are no syntax errors. An HTML validator tool can be helpful in identifying any markup issues.

Verify CSS styles: Review your CSS code and ensure that the styles are applied correctly. Check for any conflicting styles, missing selectors, or syntax errors that may lead to unexpected rendering or layout issues.

Debug JavaScript code: If you have JavaScript functionality on your static webpage, carefully review your JavaScript code. Look for any syntax errors, typos, or logical issues that may cause the expected behavior to fail. Utilize console.log statements to log relevant information and track the flow of execution.

Cross-browser testing: Test your static webpage on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility. Each browser may have its own quirks and inconsistencies, so it's important to identify and address any browser-specific issues.

Validate external resources: If your static webpage relies on external libraries or resources (such as JavaScript libraries or CSS frameworks), ensure that you are including the correct versions and that they are properly loaded. Verify the URLs and file paths to make sure the resources are accessible.

Utilize debugging tools: Depending on the tools or frameworks you are using for development, there may be additional debugging features or plugins available. For example, if you're using a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo, they may provide their own debugging utilities or error logs.
