# Exploring the Web Stack:
When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, the following series of events typically occur:

DNS Resolution: The browser sends a DNS request to a DNS resolver to translate the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.

TCP/IP Connection: Once the IP address is obtained, the browser establishes a TCP/IP connection with the server hosting www.google.com.

SSL/TLS Handshake: If the URL starts with "https://" (indicating a secure connection), the browser initiates an SSL/TLS handshake. This process establishes a secure encrypted connection between the browser and the server.

Firewall and Network Security: The request passes through any firewalls or network security measures that may be in place to protect the server and network infrastructure.

Load Balancer: In the case of high-traffic websites like Google, a load balancer may distribute the incoming request to one of several servers to balance the load and improve performance.

Web Server Processing: The web server receives the request and interprets it. It retrieves the necessary resources, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or images, to generate the requested web page.

Application Server (Optional): In more complex web applications, an application server may handle the request. It executes the business logic, interacts with databases or external services, and generates dynamic content if needed.

Database (Optional): If the web application relies on a database, the application server may query the database to retrieve or update data required to fulfill the request.

Response Generation: The web server, and optionally the application server, generates a response containing the requested web page's content, along with relevant metadata.

Response Transmission: The response is sent back over the established TCP/IP connection, encrypted if using HTTPS.

Browser Rendering: The browser receives the response and begins parsing and rendering the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the web page's content.

User Interaction: The user can now interact with the rendered web page, submit forms, click on links, or perform other actions.

In summary, the process involves DNS resolution, establishing a secure connection, passing through security measures, load balancing, server processing, potential involvement of an application server and database, and finally rendering the web page in the browser for the user to interact with.
